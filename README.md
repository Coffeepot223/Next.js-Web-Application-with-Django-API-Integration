# Next.js-Web-Application-with-Django-API-Integration
Built a web application using Next.js on the frontend and integrate it with a Django API backend. The application features a basic dashboard page with multiple charts (Candlestick, Line Chart, Bar Chart, and Pie Chart), and the data will be retrieved from the backend.
